### Notes
While building the first part of the Flixster app, I did not encounter any significant challenges. I really enjoyed following the 
instruction videos: I thought everything was explained very clearly. Additionally, I liked having walkthrough vidoes because I was 
able to watch them over again as many times as I needed in order to understand the concepts.
