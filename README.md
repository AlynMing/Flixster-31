### Notes
While developing this second part of the Flixster app, I faced a couple of challenges. The issue that took me the longest to figure
out was occured while trying to setup the Colleciton View. Things were not matching with what the instruction videos were showing and 
unexpected errors were showing. After a while, I realized the cause of the issue was that one of my files had the wrong name. Another
issue I faced was realted to the size of the posters. I fixed this issue by changing the Estimate Size of the UIImageView from automatic
to None. The TAs were really helpful in debugging with me.

### Notes
While building the first part of the Flixster app, I did not encounter any significant challenges. I really enjoyed following the 
instruction videos: I thought everything was explained very clearly. Additionally, I liked having walkthrough vidoes because I was 
able to watch them over again as many times as I needed in order to understand the concepts.
